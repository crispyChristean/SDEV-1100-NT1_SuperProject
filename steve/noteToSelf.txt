So, while you're not literally digging up cryptocurrency from the ground,The sun beat down. Dust devils danced on the horizon. Sweat stung his eyes. He swung the pickaxe, again and again. Rock. More rock. No glint of silver, no trace of the digital gold.

He wiped the sweat from his brow, the taste of dust in his mouth. The heat shimmered above the ground, distorting the landscape. Another day, another swing of the pickaxe.

He thought of the others, their faces grim, their eyes fixed on the ground. They were all digging, all searching, all hoping. The network, a vast, invisible web, stretched across the world. A million pickaxes swung in unison, a symphony of desperation.

He found a rock, smooth and cool. He held it in his hand, the rough surface a comfort. The digital gold, where was it? Buried deep, elusive, a phantom treasure.

He swung the pickaxe again. The rock shattered. No gold. Just dust.

The sun began to set. The shadows lengthened. He was tired, bone-weary. But he couldn't stop. Not yet. The network waited. The gold beckoned.

He swung the pickaxe one last time.

Nothing.

He sat down, leaning against a boulder. The stars came out, cold and distant. The network hummed, a silent, relentless machine.

He would try again tomorrow.

The End you're using powerful computers to "mine" it from the vast digital world.
